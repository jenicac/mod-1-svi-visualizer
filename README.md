# Mod 1 SVI: Neural Network SVI Visualizer

This React application visualizes how a neural network processes CDC Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) data to make predictions. It allows users to:

- Upload or select SVI data
- Configure the neural network structure (layers, neurons, activation functions)
- Visualize the network and step through forward propagation
- See activations and predictions interactively

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install --legacy-peer-deps
   ```
2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Features
- Data upload and preview
- Neural network editor
- Forward propagation visualization
- Prediction output

## Tech Stack
- React (TypeScript, PWA template)
- Modern, interactive UI
