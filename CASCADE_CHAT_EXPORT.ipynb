    "#### 1. User: Export this to a new github repository\n\n",
    "**Assistant:**\nTo export your project to a new GitHub repository, hereâ€™s what Iâ€™ll do:\n1. Initialize a git repository in your project folder (if not already done).\n2. Create a `.gitignore` for Node/React projects.\n3. Add all files and make an initial commit.\n4. Guide you to create a new GitHub repo (I canâ€™t do this step for you, but Iâ€™ll give you the exact steps and command).\n5. Push your code to the new GitHub repository.\n\nLetâ€™s get started!"

    "#### 3. User: fatal error not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git\n\n**Assistant:**\nThe error occurred because you ran the git commands from `C:\\Users\\jcene` instead of the project directory `C:\\Users\\jcene\\CascadeProjects\\mod-1-svi`, where the `.git` folder exists.\n\n**How to fix:**  \nRun the following commands from the correct project directory:\n\n```
cd C:\\Users\\jcene\\CascadeProjects\\mod-1-svi\ngit remote add origin https://github.com/jenicac/mod-1-svi-visualizer.git\ngit branch -M main\ngit push -u origin main\n```\n\nLet me know if you want me to run these commands for you, or if you encounter any more errors!"
